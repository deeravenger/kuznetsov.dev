This limitation changes the approach to development. A small project that could be implemented in a month full-time (40 hours a week for 4 weeks, totaling ~160 hours), stretches over 4 months at 10 hours a week. This significantly affects the perception of the project.</h2><h2 id=why-motivation-is-a-constraint--ive-started-and-abandoned-projects-many-times-motivation-is-a-tricky-thing-at-the-beginning-the-idea-inspires-you-and-youre-ready-to-work-247-to-quickly-see-the-result-the-problem-is-that-this-mode-of-work-negatively-impacts-personal-life-and-primary-job-if-you-dont-see-results-for-a-long-time-motivation-disappears-its-hard-to-work-on-something-for-4-months-that-doesnt-bring-tangible-results-when-you-could-be-spending-time-with-family-and-friends>Why Motivation is a Constraint I&rsquo;ve started (and abandoned) projects many times. Motivation is a tricky thing. At the beginning, the idea inspires you, and you&rsquo;re ready to work 24/7 to quickly see the result. The problem is that this mode of work negatively impacts personal life and primary job. If you don&rsquo;t see results for a long time, motivation disappears. It&rsquo;s hard to work on something for 4 months that doesn&rsquo;t bring tangible results when you could be spending time with family and friends.</h2><h2 id=how-to-deal-with-this--looking-back-both-constraints-seem-obvious-but-i-didnt-take-them-into-account-for-a-long-time-at-some-point-i-realized-their-impact-and-started-looking-for-ways-to-get-around-them-to-not-abandon-my-endeavors--like-any-developer-early-in-my-career-i-thought-i-would-soon-launch-a-project-that-will-start-making-a-lot-of-money-a-win-win-doing-what-you-love-and-getting-lots-of-freedom-and-money-in-reality-it-turned-out-that-development-is-only-a-small-part-of-the-process-which-by-itself-rarely-leads-to-financial-success-i-tried-to-launch-various-projects-but-lacked-experience-knowledge-and-ultimately-motivation-as-a-result-the-projects-were-abandoned--at-some-point-i-came-up-with-a-formula-that-has-been-working-for-me-for-several-years-i-decided-that-i-will-only-develop-projects-that-i-can-use-myself-and-start-using-them-within-the-first-two-months--this-approach-greatly-influenced-how-i-conduct-development-in-my-10-hours-a-week-i-realized-i-could-think-about-ideas-or-do-project-planning-during-commuting-or-household-chores-to-make-the-most-of-available-time-for-implementation-i-also-cut-back-on-functionality-as-much-as-possible-focusing-only-on-the-most-important-features-and-not-spending-time-on-ui-eg-layout-since-that-is-the-most-time-consuming-part-for-me-i-can-start-using-a-project-on-bootstrap-and-make-it-beautiful-over-time--over-time-i-have-accumulated-a-set-of-practices-and-tools-that-i-use-in-the-development-of-my-projects-while-the-tools-are-more-or-less-clear-i-would-like-to-share-the-practices-separately-probably-in-the-next-post>How to Deal With This? Looking back, both constraints seem obvious, but I didn&rsquo;t take them into account for a long time. At some point, I realized their impact and started looking for ways to get around them to not abandon my endeavors. Like any developer, early in my career, I thought I would soon launch a project that will start making a lot of money. A win-win: doing what you love and getting lots of freedom and money. In reality, it turned out that development is only a small part of the process, which by itself rarely leads to financial success. I tried to launch various projects, but lacked experience, knowledge, and, ultimately, motivation. As a result, the projects were abandoned. At some point, I came up with a formula that has been working for me for several years. I decided that <strong>I will only develop projects that I can use myself and start using them within the first two months</strong>. This approach greatly influenced how I conduct development in my 10 hours a week. I realized I could think about ideas or do project planning during commuting or household chores to make the most of available time for implementation. I also cut back on functionality as much as possible, focusing only on the most important features and not spending time on UI (e.g., layout) since that is the most time-consuming part for me. I can start using a project on Bootstrap and make it beautiful over time. Over time, I have accumulated a set of practices and tools that I use in the development of my projects. While the tools are more or less clear, I would like to share the practices separately (probably in the next post).</h2><h2 id=how-to-apply-this-in-managerial-work--concerning-motivation--this-is-also-relevant-when-working-in-a-company-as-a-manager-i-have-to-maintain-the-motivation-of-engineers-one-way-to-do-this-is-by-organizing-projects-so-that-we-can-get-feedback-as-early-as-possible-developing-in-small-iterations-helps-achieve-this-the-main-problem-is-that-many-developers-and-managers-too-do-not-want-or-do-not-know-how-to-work-in-small-steps-and-often-this-is-an-ingrained-culture-in-the-company-that-is-extremely-difficult-to-change-as-a-result-development-drags-on-motivation-drops-and-projects-are-abandoned-without-bringing-any-benefit-to-the-company>How to Apply This in Managerial Work Concerning motivation — this is also relevant when working in a company. As a manager, I have to maintain the motivation of engineers. One way to do this is by organizing projects so that we can get feedback as early as possible. Developing in small iterations helps achieve this. The main problem is that many developers (and managers too) do not want or do not know how to work in small steps, and often, this is an ingrained culture in the company that is extremely difficult to change. As a result, development drags on, motivation drops, and projects are abandoned without bringing any benefit to the company.</h2></div><div class=post__footer></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer__base"><ul class=footer__list><li class=footer__item>&copy;
